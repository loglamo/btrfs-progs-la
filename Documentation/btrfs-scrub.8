.SH NAME
btrfs-scrub \- scrub btrfs filesystem, verify block checksums
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBbtrfs scrub\fP <subcommand> <args>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Scrub is a pass over all filesystem data and metadata and verifying the
checksums. If a valid copy is available (replicated block group profiles) then
the damaged one is repaired. All copies of the replicated profiles are validated.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Scrub is not a filesystem checker (fsck) and does not verify nor repair
structural damage in the filesystem. It really only checks checksums of data
and tree blocks, it doesn\(aqt ensure the content of tree blocks is valid and
consistent. There\(aqs some validation performed when metadata blocks are read
from disk (\fI\%Tree checker\fP) but it\(aqs not extensive and cannot substitute
full \fI\%btrfs\-check(8)\fP run.

.sp
The user is supposed to run it manually or via a periodic system service. The
recommended period is a month but it could be less. The estimated device bandwidth
utilization is about 80% on an idle filesystem.
.sp
The scrubbing status is recorded in \fB/var/lib/btrfs/\fP in textual files named
\fIscrub.status.UUID\fP for a filesystem identified by the given UUID. (Progress
state is communicated through a named pipe in file \fIscrub.progress.UUID\fP in the
same directory.) The status file is updated every 5 seconds. A resumed scrub
will continue from the last saved position.
.sp
Scrub can be started only on a mounted filesystem, though it\(aqs possible to
scrub only a selected device. See \fI\%btrfs scrub start\fP for more.

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fI\%ionice(1)\fP may not be generally supported by all IO schedulers and
the options to \fBbtrfs scrub start\fP may not work as expected.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the past when the \fI\%CFQ IO scheduler\fP was generally used
the \fI\%ionice(1)\fP syscalls set the priority to \fIidle\fP so the IO would not
interfere with regular IO. Since the kernel 5.0 the CFQ is not available.
.sp
The IO scheduler known to support that is \fI\%BFQ\fP, but first read the
documentation before using it!
.sp
For other commonly used schedulers like \fI\%mq\-deadline\fP it\(aqs recommended to use
\fIcgroup2 IO controller\fP which could be managed by e.g. \fIsystemd\fP
(documented in \fBsystemd.resource\-control\fP). However, starting scrub like that
is not yet completely straightforward. The IO controller must know the physical
device of the filesystem and create a slice so all processes started from that
belong to the same accounting group.

Since linux 5.14 it\(aqs possible to set the per\-device bandwidth limits in a
BTRFS\-specific way using files \fB/sys/fs/btrfs/FSID/devinfo/DEVID/scrub_speed_max\fP\&.
This setting is not persistent, lasts until the filesystem is unmounted.
Currently set limits can be displayed by command \fI\%btrfs scrub
limit\fP\&.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B cancel <path>|<device>
If a scrub is running on the filesystem identified by \fIpath\fP or
\fIdevice\fP, cancel it.
.sp
If a \fIdevice\fP is specified, the corresponding filesystem is found and
\fBbtrfs scrub cancel\fP behaves as if it was called on that filesystem.
The progress is saved in the status file so \fBbtrfs scrub resume\fP can
continue from the last position.

.B resume [\-BdqrR] <path>|<device>
Resume a cancelled or interrupted scrub on the filesystem identified by
\fIpath\fP or on a given \fIdevice\fP\&. The starting point is read from the
status file if it exists.
.sp
This does not start a new scrub if the last scrub finished successfully.

.B start [\-BdrRf] <path>|<device>
Start a scrub on all devices of the mounted filesystem identified by
\fIpath\fP or on a single \fIdevice\fP\&. If a scrub is already running, the new
one will not start. A device of an unmounted filesystem cannot be
scrubbed this way.
.sp
Without options, scrub is started as a background process. The
automatic repairs of damaged copies are performed by default for block
group profiles with redundancy. No\-repair can be enabled by option \fI\-r\fP\&.
